<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I grew up in China, moved to France for my study and I'm now living in
    London. During the day I'm a Research Engineer at DeepMind where I work on
    interesting open problems in machine learning. My current focus sits at the
    intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent and Continuous Control.
